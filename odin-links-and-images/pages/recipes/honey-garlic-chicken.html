    <h1>Honey Garlic Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../images/honeygarlicchicken.webp" alt="Chicken" height="310" width="410">
        <p>This sauce for chicken breast is a variation of my Honey Garlic Salmon which has been popular with readers for many years.</p>

        <p>If I were ever to do a summary of my top 5 Most Used Sauces, Honey Garlic Sauce would probably be right at the top of the list. I love it because it requires so few ingredients that are pantry staples, and when simmered with a seared protein in a skillet so it becomes all bubbly and syrupy…. oh WOW.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>500g / 1 lb chicken breast</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
                <li>3 1/2 tbsp (50g) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the breasts in half horizontally to create 4 steaks in total. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.</li>
                <li>Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat – hold back about 1 tsp for later.</li>
                <li>Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2 – 3 minutes until golden. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Turn heat down slightly to medium high.</li>
                <li>Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter. Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.</li>
                <li>Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir / shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.</li>
                <li>Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of water and stir.</li>
                <li>Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over remaining sauce.</li>
            </ol>
